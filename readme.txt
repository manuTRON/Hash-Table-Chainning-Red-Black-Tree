Generic Hash Table (chaining implementation using Generic Red-Black Tree)

To run the project:
1) Import the project in your in your workspace of Eclipse IDE.
2) Open the package named tester.
3) Inside it run HashTableUsingRBTMain.java

=====================================================================================

We have a Tester which contains a Mobile class.
In the main() method we have used the HashTable to store information entered by user.

We have entered some data already for Testing purpose.

A Menu system has been created for the user to:

1) Add a new Mobile (uses insert() method of HashTable which uses insert() method of RB Tree)

2) Delete a Mobile (uses delete() method of HashTable which uses delete() method of RB Tree)

3) Display Mobiles (uses display() method of HashTable -- This method displays the data entered in every bucket of HashTable in an Inorder Traversal format).

4) Search for Mobile details using the IMEI No. (uses the search() method of HashTable which uses the find() method of RB Tree)
